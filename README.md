# Simple-Calculator

🧮 Simple-Calculator

My first VB.NET project! 🎉
This is a simple calculator created while following a YouTube tutorial. This project helped me learn the basics of VB.NET syntax and programming logic.

⚡ Features

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division ➕➖✖️➗

Clear button to reset input 🧹

User-friendly interface with buttons for numbers and operations

Built using VB.NET and Windows Forms

🗂️ Folder Structure

Here’s where you can find the executable file if you want to run it:

Simple-Calculator (repo root)
├─ SimpleCalculator/
│   ├─ Form1.vb
│   ├─ Form1.Designer.vb
│   ├─ My Project/
│   └─ bin/
│       └─ Release/
│           └─ net10.0-windows/
│               └─ SimpleCalculator.exe


Tip: The bin/ folder contains compiled files and can usually be ignored when uploading to GitHub. Only include source files like .vb and the .slnx solution file. ✅

🚀 How to Run the Project

Open Visual Studio 2022 (or newer)

Open the solution file:

SimpleCalculator.slnx


Press F5 or click Start to run the calculator.

💡 Notes

The program is built in Release mode by default.

If you can’t see the .exe, make sure you build the solution first in Visual Studio.

Avoid uploading the bin/ and obj/ folders to GitHub; they are temporary build files.
